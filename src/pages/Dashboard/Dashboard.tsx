        What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
        and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
        not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
        the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact
        that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
        looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using Content
        here, content here, making it look like readable English. Many desktop
        publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
        default model text, and a search for lorem ipsum will uncover many web
        sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
        years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and
        the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem
        Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
        McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
        Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
        sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The
        Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
        treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from
        a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since
        the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
        1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced
        in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the
        1914 translation by H. Rackham.
